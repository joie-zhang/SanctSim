1. **Experiment Automation**
   ```
   /crud-claude-commands create run-experiment
   ```
   Design it to handle your specific:
   - Configuration management
   - Result validation
   - Metric tracking

   /crud-claude-commands create paper-to-code
   ```
   For implementing papers:
   - Extract key algorithms
   - Generate test cases
   - Verify correctness
</custom_commands>

<autonomous_command_usage>
### Guiding Principles for Your Custom Commands

When creating commands for your research, consider these patterns:

#### Command Triggers
Design your commands to activate on specific patterns:
- Research-specific terminology
- Repeated workflows
- Common analysis needs
- Debugging scenarios

#### Example Patterns to Implement

1. **Experiment Management**
   ```python
   # When user mentions "run experiment" or "test hypothesis"
   if "experiment" in message or "hypothesis" in message:
       use_command("/run-experiment", config=extract_config())
   ```

2. **Results Analysis**
   ```python
   # When results are generated
   if "results ready" or "analyze output":
       use_command("/analyze-results", metrics=domain_specific_metrics)
   ```

3. **Context Preservation**
   ```python
   # Always monitor context usage
   if context_usage > 0.7:
       suggest_command("/page", reason="preserve progress")
   elif context_usage > 0.8:
       auto_command("/page", name=generate_checkpoint_name())
   ```

#### Building Reliable Automation

1. **Start with Manual Commands**: Run commands manually first to understand patterns
2. **Identify Repetition**: Notice when you use the same command sequence
3. **Create Composite Commands**: Combine common sequences into single commands
4. **Add Verification**: Always include checks to ensure commands worked
5. **Document Failures**: Track when commands fail and why

#### Integration with External Tools
Your custom commands can integrate with:
- Experiment tracking (Weights & Biases, MLflow)
- Compute clusters (SLURM, Ray)
- Version control (Git workflows)
- Data pipelines (DVC, Pachyderm)
- Analysis tools (Jupyter, Pandas)
</autonomous_command_usage>

<autonomous_scripts>
### Autonomous Research Scripts

All slash commands now have programmatic versions in `scripts/commands/` that can be executed autonomously:

#### Codebase Integration
```bash
# Integrate external codebase
python scripts/integrate_codebase.py https://github.com/org/repo.git
```

#### Automatic Context Planning
```bash
# Create implementation plan with automatic context selection
python scripts/commands/plan_auto_context.py "add caching layer to improve API performance"

# With external tools (repomix + Gemini)
python scripts/commands/plan_auto_context.py "implement websocket notifications" --output plan.md
```

#### Orchestrated Workflows
```bash
# Run comprehensive analysis workflow
python scripts/commands/orchestrate_research.py \
    --workflow comprehensive_analysis \
    --codebase ./project \
    --task "Analyze security architecture"
```

#### Multi-Model Coordination
The orchestration script supports:
- Parallel execution of multiple tools
- Custom workflow definitions
- Automatic report generation
- Integration with Gemini, O3, and other models

See `scripts/README.md` for complete documentation.
</autonomous_scripts>

<thinking_guidelines>
## Extended Thinking Usage

For complex problems, I will use extended thinking when you include trigger phrases:
- "think step by step" - Basic reasoning
- "think deeply" - More thorough analysis
- "think harder" - Complex problem solving
- "ultrathink" - Maximum reasoning depth

Best used for:
- Mathematical proofs and derivations
- Architecture decisions with multiple trade-offs
- Debugging subtle issues
- Research hypothesis formation
- Safety analysis and failure mode identification
</thinking_guidelines>

## Best Practices for Maximum Efficiency

<prompting_best_practices>
### Be Explicit and Context-Rich
Instead of: "Implement caching"
Use: "Implement an LRU cache for model embeddings with 10GB capacity, <100ms lookup time, and thread-safe operations. This will be used in production serving 1M+ requests/day."

### Provide Success Examples
<example>
Task: "Create a configuration system"
Good: "Create a configuration system like Hydra that supports:
- Hierarchical configs with overrides
- Type validation using Pydantic
- Environment variable interpolation
- Config versioning for reproducibility
Output should follow this structure:
```yaml
model:
  type: transformer
  params:
    layers: 12
    hidden_dim: 768
```
"
</example>

### Leverage Parallel Operations
"For maximum efficiency, analyze these three papers simultaneously using separate agents:
1. Paper A: Focus on methodology
2. Paper B: Extract experimental results
3. Paper C: Identify limitations
Synthesize findings focusing on common patterns."

### Control Output Format
<formatting>
For structured outputs:
- Use XML tags: "Provide analysis in <findings>, <methodology>, and <limitations> tags"
- Request specific formats: "Output as JSON with schema: {metric: string, value: float, confidence: float}"
- Prefill patterns: "Begin your response with '## Technical Analysis\n### Key Findings:'"
</formatting>
</prompting_best_practices>

## Integration with External Tools

<tool_integration>
### Gemini CLI for Large-Scale Analysis
Use when Claude's context would be exceeded:
```bash
# Analyze entire codebases
gemini -p "@src/ Explain the architecture and identify coupling points"

# Compare multiple papers
gemini -p "@paper1.pdf @paper2.pdf @paper3.pdf Synthesize approaches to adversarial robustness"

# Find patterns across many files
gemini -p "@**/*.py List all custom loss functions with their mathematical formulations"
```

### Git Integration
- Commits: Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Branches: `feature/<issue-no>-<description>` or `experiment/<name>`
- PRs: Include test results and performance impact

### Testing Frameworks
- Always verify framework first: `grep -r "test_" . | head -5`
- Prefer pytest for Python, jest for JavaScript
- Include property-based tests for critical functions
</tool_integration>

## Session Management Best Practices

<session_management>
1. **Track Progress**: Maintain `todo.md` with checkboxes for complex tasks
2. **Checkpoint Regularly**: `/page` when switching contexts or at major milestones
3. **Resume Gracefully**: `claude --resume <checkpoint>` preserves full context
4. **Clean Up**: Remove temporary files and close unused resources

### Memory Limits and Optimization
- Monitor context usage with `/compact` when >70% full
- Summarize intermediate results rather than keeping full outputs
- Use external storage for large datasets or logs
</session_management>

## Security and Safety Guidelines

<security_guidelines>
1. **Never Expose**: API keys, credentials, or personal information
2. **Validate Inputs**: Sanitize all external data before processing
3. **Audit Outputs**: Review generated code for potential vulnerabilities
4. **Version Control**: Never commit sensitive data, use .gitignore
5. **Access Control**: Implement principle of least privilege
</security_guidelines>

## Common Patterns and Solutions

<common_patterns>
### For Research Algorithms
"Implement the algorithm ensuring:
- Numerical stability and error propagation analysis
- Comprehensive unit tests with edge cases
- Performance benchmarks on relevant datasets
- Memory and computational complexity profiling
- Full reproducibility (seeds, environments, dependencies)
- Systematic ablation study support
Document theoretical foundations, empirical validation, and limitations."

### For Experimental Analysis
"Implement the analysis pipeline with:
- Statistical significance testing
- Multiple hypothesis correction
- Confidence interval calculation
- Effect size estimation
- Robustness checks across conditions
- Visualization of key relationships
Include assumption validation and sensitivity analysis."

### For Research Infrastructure
"Build the experimental framework with:
- Parameter sweep and grid search capabilities
- Distributed computation support
- Checkpoint and recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Experiment tracking and versioning
- Automated report generation
Ensure reproducibility across different environments and scales."
</common_patterns>
